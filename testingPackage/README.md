# Usage

This package contains code for testing a new bot. 
In order to test your bot, please download the following list of files from this folder into the same folder on your device (the files must be in a location that can import python modules, specifically math and random):
- testingSylverV*.py (note: V* refers to the most updated version of the file)
- numericalSemigroupLite.py

The following files are optional but will allow you to test your bot against my bots:
- newBestBot.py
- oldUpdatedBestBot.py
- myNewBotOld.py
- myNewBot.py
- testingBot2.py
- testingBot4.py

Once these files are downloaded into a folder, add a file called "myOwnBot.py" which has a class "myBot" with a function "nextMove" to the folder.

Then, simply run the code "testingSylverV*.py" to test your bot.
